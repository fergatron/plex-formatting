# plex formatting
# The purpose of this script is to read a directory and rename the files to
# match a format that fits with Plex Media Server's standards.

# The MVP of this script will just rename file names to be lowercase and replace
# spaces with hypens. I'll worry myself with more advanced stuff later.

# $1 - directory
